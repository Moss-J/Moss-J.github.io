title: Aerial Cinematography for Settlements in Minecraftâ€“Toward Their Crowd Assessment
---

We designed a system that can automatically generate screening videos in the [Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/). This system learns the movement when the judge is judging the map of Minecraft, and automatically generates videoes by building a learning model of Decision Tree. In this article, we will show some tables and animations of experimental results.

Also you can see our source-code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC).
The experimental data is also included.

## Raw Data

Here is an example of raw data from [DataCollector](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC/blob/main/DataCollector.py).

Features name include '**S**' changed to '**O**' in the paper.

## Cross-validation Results of Different Models 

We used the cross-validation method to find the appropriate features and the method to build the model, and established a suitable model for each player.

The result of the figure below comes from [AccuracyCalculation_distance.py](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC/blob/main/AccuracyCalculation_distance.py)

## Animations

The following are some animations generated on the test map using most suitable model for each player. There are 3 players in total, and there are 3 benchmarks(Player Decision, Decision Tree, Toward Center) for each player.
