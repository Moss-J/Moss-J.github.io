title: Aerial Cinematography for Settlements in Minecraftâ€“Toward Their Crowd Assessment
---

We designed a system that can automatically generate screening videos in the [Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/). This system learns the movement when the judge is judging the map of Minecraft, and automatically generates videoes by building a learning model of Decision Tree. In this article, we will show some tables and animations of experimental results.

Also you can see our source-code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC).
The experimental data is also included.

## Raw Data

Here is an example of raw data from [DataCollector](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC/blob/main/DataCollector.py).

Feature names like '**S_xxx**' were renamed to '**O_xxx**' in the paper.

## Cross-validation Results 

We used the cross-validation method to find the appropriate features and the method to build the model, and established a suitable model for each player.

The example result of the figure below comes from [AccuracyCalculation_distance.py](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC/blob/main/AccuracyCalculation_distance.py)

## Decision Tree Model

According to the cv results and the distance from the settlement center, we created 3 models for each player, and defined the input features and parameters (criterion, max depth) that the models should use.

The model we built for each player is as follows:

- **F** means input features
- **C** means criterion
- **Opt** means the optical flow of the current scene
- **Col** means the color entropy of the current scene
- **Dir** means the direction from the current position and orientation toward the settlement center
- **Dis** means the distance between the current position and the settlement center

## Animations

The following are some animations generated on the test map using most suitable model for each player. There are 3 players in total, and there are 3 benchmarks(Player Decision, Decision Tree, Toward Center) for each player.
