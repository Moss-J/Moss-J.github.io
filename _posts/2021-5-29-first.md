title: A Drone AI Cinematographer for Settlements in Minecraftâ€“Toward Their Crowd Assessment
---

In this article, we will introduce a system that can automatically generate screening videos in the [Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/). This system learns the movement when the judge is judging the map of Minecraft, and automatically generates a video by building a learning model. 
Also you can see our source-code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC)
