title: A Drone AI Cinematographer for Settlements in Minecraftâ€“Toward Their Crowd Assessment
---

We designed a system that can automatically generate screening videos in the [Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/). This system learns the movement when the judge is judging the map of Minecraft, and automatically generates videoes by building a learning model of Decision Tree. In this article, we will show some tables and animations of experimental results.

Also you can see our source-code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC).
The experimental data is also included.

## Raw Data

Here is an example of raw data from [DataCollector](https://github.com/Moss-J/Cinematographer-in-GDMC/blob/main/DataCollector.py).

## Animations

The following are some animations generated on the test map. There are 3 players in total, and there are 3 benchmarks(Player Decision, Decision Tree, Toward Center) for each player.
